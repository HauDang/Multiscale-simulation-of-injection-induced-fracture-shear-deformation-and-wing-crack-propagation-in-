# Simulation of injection induced fracture mechanics with runscripts

This code implements examples of the published paper:

H Dang-Trung, I Berre, E Keilegavlen. Two-level simulation of injection-induced fracture slip and wing-crack propagation in poroelastic media. International Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences 160, 105248


Highlights:
1. Multiscale simulation of fracture slip and propagation caused by fluid injection in poroelastic, fractured media.
2. Quasi-static micro-scale simulations of fracture propagation combined with macro-scale simulation of flow and deformation of fractured poroelastic media. 
3. Open-source 2D implementation, including local adaptive remeshing on the micro and macroscale. 
4. Control volume methods for macro-scale Poroelasticity and contact mechanics combined with finite-element simulation of fracture propagation.

To run the examples contained in this repository a working version of PorePy (Version 1.3.0) must be installed on the computer.
The PorePy install requires installations of further packages, see Install instructions in the PorePy repository.
